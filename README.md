- separate the elements in a single row with either a comma (,) or a space.

 ```
  [1 2 3 4] [1,2,3,4]
```

- separate the rows with semicolons or 'return'

  ```
  a = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 10]

  a = [1 2 3
      4 5 6
      7 8 10]
  ```

-  All variables of all data types in MATLAB are multidimensional arrays.  
   A vector is a one-dimensional array and a matrix is a two-dimensional array.   
   Special Arrays in MATLAB
```
 zeros(n), ones(m,n),eye(n), rand(m.n) ,magic(n)
```

-  Matrix and Array Operations
```
a = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 10]
a + 10
sin(a)
a'  ;  transpose(a)

p = a*inv(a)

format long
p
format short
p
```

-  element-wise operators
```
p = a.*a
a.^3
```

-  Concatenation
```
A = [a,a]
A = [a; a]
```

-  Complex Numbers
```
sqrt(-1)
c = [3+4i, 4+3j; -i, 10j]
```

-  Multidimensional Arrays

```
a
a(:, :, 2)= [ 7 6 3; 1 9 2; 4 8 5]
```

-  We can also create multidimensional arrays using the ones(), zeros() or the rand() functions.
```
b = rand(4,3,2)
```

-  Array Indexing
```
A = magic(4)
A(4,2)   %The most common way is to specify row and column subscripts
A(8)    %use a single subscript that traverses down each column in order:
A(1:3,2)   %use the colon operator, which allows you to specify a range of the form start:end
A(3,:)   %The colon alone, without start or end values, specifies all of the elements in that dimension. 

- The colon operator also allows you to create an equally spaced vector of values using the more general form start:step:end.

B = 0:10:100
```

- Deleting a Row or a Column in a Matrix
```
a = [ 1 2 3 4 5; 2 3 4 5 6; 3 4 5 6 7; 4 5 6 7 8];
a( 4 , : ) = []       %delete the fourth row of a 
```

-  Array Functions  
size,length,ndims,diag ,numel,sort  

```
x = [7.1, 3.4, 7.2, 28/4, 3.6, 17, 9.4, 8.9];
length(x)     % length of x vector
y = rand(3, 4, 5, 2);
ndims(y)      % no of dimensions in array y
s = ['Zara', 'Nuha', 'Shamim', 'Riz', 'Shadab'];
numel(s)     % no of elements in s
```

```
sort(x)
m = [2 6 4; 5 3 9; 2 0 1]    % two dimensional array
sort(m, 1)                   % sorting m along the row
sort(m, 2)                   % sorting m along the column
size(m)  
```

 -  The simplest type of MATLABÂ® program is called a script. A script is a file with a .m extension  
 that contains multiple sequential lines of MATLAB commands and function calls.   
 You can run a script by typing its name at the command line.


-  edit a script file named "plotrand.m" as following:

```
% Generate random data from a uniform distribution
% and calculate the mean. Plot the data and the mean.
 
n = 50;            % 50 data points
r = rand(n,1);
plot(r)
 
% Draw a line from (0,m) to (n,m)
m = mean(r);
hold on
plot([0,n],[m,m])
hold off
title('Mean of Random Uniform Data')
```

-  Save the file in the current folder. To run the script, type its name at the command line:

plotrand
